hash-im
=======

Minimal telehash-based IM library.

## Example CLI

Run this:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then it should have you connected and show you your hashname, you can type `/to e131f39683855d3a2cf5e1f73f0a95666619faecebcf4e370d596bf20465b6c6` and if I'm online (jer) you'll be connected in an encrypted p2p IM chat to me :)

## Library

There's currently not a lot of documentation, but the code is fairly simple.
